:pico:Don't call me boy. My name's Pico.
:betty:Sure thing, Pico.
:betty:You can call me Betty. Betty Alpha.

:pico:Did a guy with blue hair, a hat, and a microphone pass through this place earlier?
:betty:About an hour ago, yes.

:betty:Let's not be so hasty now.
:betty:How about I tell you after a short lesson on typing?
:pico:......
