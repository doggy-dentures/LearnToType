:dad:You there!
:betty:Hmm, me?
:dad:Yes, who are you?
:betty:The name's Betty. Betty Alpha.
:dad:When did you get here?!
:betty:I've always been here. This is where I give my lessons on typing.
:dad:No, you have not always been here.
:dad:You don't even look like you come from the same dimension as us.
:dad:This is my property. I bought this land twenty years ago.
:dad:When did you turn MY land into this technicolor schoolhouse?
:betty:Don't be so silly. You must be thinking of some other land.
:betty:Since you're already here, how about a lesson on typing?
:dad:How about an eviction notice?
