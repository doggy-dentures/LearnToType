:senpai:Huh? Where am I?
:betty:Welcome, stranger! What's your name?
:senpai:Uh, Senpai?
:betty:Nice to meet you! My name's Betty Alpha!
:senpai:Say, I think I'm lost. Do you know the way back to the school building?
:betty:School? You're in the right place then!
:senpai:Err, no. Not this schoolhouse. I'm talking about the school with all the cherry blossoms.
:betty:Well, are you at least here to learn?
:betty:If so, I have loads to teach you about typing!
:betty:Let's start our first lesson.
:senpai:Uh...I'm not so sure about this.
:betty:C'mon, this will be easy for a smart, pretty boy like you.
:senpai:Smart and pretty, you say?
:senpai:...Hmph, of course! This will be a breeze for me!
